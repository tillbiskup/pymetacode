pymetacode documentation
========================

Welcome! This is the documentation for pymetacode, a Python package helping to write and maintain Python packages.

Code that writes code - yes, that's correct. Automating the boring stuff, one could say, or helping to focus on the creative part of programming. In any case, the idea for this package stems from experience with a couple of Python projects, and as such it is pretty opinionated, focussing on personal needs regarding structure and layout. Nevertheless, it tries to be as user-friendly as possible, coming with an intuitive command-line interface (CLI).


Features
========

A list of features:

* Create initial package structure (directory layout, files)

* Add module, class, and function scaffolds to an existing project, including tests and API documentation

* Intuitive command-line interface (CLI)


And to make it even more convenient for users and future-proof:

* Open source project written in Python (>= 3.7)

* Developed fully test-driven

* Extensive user and API documentation



.. warning::
    pymetacode is currently under active development and still considered in Beta development state. Therefore, expect frequent changes in features and public APIs that may break your own code. Nevertheless, feedback as well as feature requests are highly welcome.


Installation
============

To install the pymetacode package on your computer (sensibly within a Python virtual environment), open a terminal (activate your virtual environment), and type in the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pymetacode
