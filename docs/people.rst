People behind pymetacode
========================

Who are the people behind the pymetacode package?

The pymetacode package is developed by `Till Biskup <https://www.till-biskup.de/>`_, a scientist working in the field of spectroscopy who actively develops a series of Python packages for the processing and analysis of spectroscopic data, most prominently the `ASpecD framework <https://docs.aspecd.de/>`_ and a series of packages derived from this package and dedicated to work with `cw-EPR <https://docs.cwepr.de>`_, `tr-EPR <https://docs.trepr.de>`_, and `UV-vis <https://docs.uvvispy.de>`_ data.

His main focus with these packages is on ensuring `reproducible research <https://www.reproducible-research.de/>`_, something still sadly not really taken seriously in the community nor worked towards.

The pymetacode package was created to facilitate development of the own packages, and its first working version (0.1.0) including the design of the CLI is largely the result of a productive weekend.
