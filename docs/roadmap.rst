Roadmap
=======

A few ideas how to develop the project further, currently a list as a reminder for the main developers themselves, in no particular order, though with a tendency to list more important aspects first:


For version 0.4
===============

* Update command (*e.g.*, for configuration, setup.py)

* Command for copying templates to user-specific/site-wide directory


For later versions
==================

* More configuration options.

* Commands for releasing a package to PyPI
