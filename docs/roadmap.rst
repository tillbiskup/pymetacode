Roadmap
=======

A few ideas how to develop the project further, currently a list as a reminder for the main developers themselves, in no particular order, though with a tendency to list more important aspects first:


For version 0.2
===============

* Add prospector configuration.

* Automatic alphabetical sorting of modules in API index.


For later versions
==================

* Templates adjustable by user (local install)/by other package.

* More configuration options.

* Commands for releasing a package to PyPI
