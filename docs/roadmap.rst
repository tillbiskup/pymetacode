Roadmap
=======

A few ideas how to develop the project further, currently a list as a reminder for the main developers themselves, in no particular order, though with a tendency to list more important aspects first:


For version 0.1
===============

* Finish documentation

  * More examples how the automatically created code looks like (?)

  * Examples for help texts of CLI

* Prepare for release (prospector, tox, ...)


For later versions
==================

* Automatic alphabetical sorting of modules in API index.

* Templates adjustable by user (local install)/by other package.

* More configuration options.

* Add prospector configuration.

* Commands for releasing a package to PyPI
