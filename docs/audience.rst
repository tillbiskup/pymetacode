Who is the target audience of the pymetacode package? Is it interesting for me?

The pymetacode package aims at routine programmers who focus on consistency, portable and deployable code, are not afraid of using unit tests and Sphinx for their documentation, and are bored by having to copy&paste code (and too often forget to change some things this way).

The pymetacode package is clearly **opinionated**, making a lot of decisions on how to do things, starting with the overall package directory layout. Nevertheless, it tries to go out of the way of the programmer as much as possible and provides a simple, yet powerful command-line interface (CLI) for the daily usage.

**Fun fact:** The package itself has been developed originally by using a predecessor of itself and continues to be developed by help of itself. Hence, it less of an intellectual playground than a tool for the daily business of a routine programmer.
