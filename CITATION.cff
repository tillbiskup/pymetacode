title: pymetacode
abstract: >
    pymetacode is a Python package helping to write and maintain Python packages.

    Code that writes code - yes, thatâ€™s correct. Automating the boring stuff, one could say, or helping to focus on the creative part of programming. In any case, the idea for this package stems from experience with a couple of Python projects, and as such it is pretty opinionated, focussing on personal needs regarding structure and layout. Nevertheless, it tries to be as user-friendly as possible, coming with an intuitive command-line interface (CLI).
