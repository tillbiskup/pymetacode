"""
Auxiliary functionality used by other modules of the pymetacode package.

To avoid circular dependencies, this module does *not* depend on any other
modules of the pymetacode package, but it can be imported into every other
module.

As naturally, a utils module tends to be a bit messy, the different tools
available are listed below according to more general categories.


Files and I/O
=============

* :func:`ensure_file_exists`

  Create an (empty) file if it does not exist already.

* :func:`get_data_from_pkg_resources`

  Obtain contents from a non-code file stored within the package.

* :func:`change_working_dir`

  Context manager for temporarily changing the working directory.

* :func:`make_executable`

  Make a file executable, *i.e.*, set its executable flag.


String manipulation
===================

* :func:`camel_case_to_underscore`

  Change string from camel case to using underscores.

* :func:`underscore_to_camel_case`

  Change string from underscores to using camel case.


Manipulating file contents
==========================

Part of metacoding is to manipulate file contents after the files have
been generated using templates. Hence, it is sometimes not easily possible
to parse the entire file into a sensible structure. Therefore, rather
complex search and insert operations need to be performed.

The following functions exist currenty:

* :func:`add_to_toctree`

  Add entries to toctrees in documentation generated via Sphinx


Helper classes
==============

* :class:`ToDictMixin`

  Mixin class for returning all public attributes as dict.

* :class:`Template`

  Wrapper for using the template engine (Jinja2).

def ensure_file_exists(name=""):
    """
    Create an (empty) file if it does not exist already.

    This is similar to the "touch" command from unixoid operating systems,
    although it does *not* change the timestamp of the file.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : :class:`str`

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        Raised if no filename is given.

        pass


def get_package_data(name="", directory="templates"):
    """
    Obtain contents from a non-code file ("package data").

    There are generally three places where package data can be stored:

    #. Within the package,

    #. In the site-wide data directory (with the package name as subdirectory),

    #. In the user-specific data directory
       (with the package name as subdirectory).

    The location of the latter two is specific to the operating system used.
    Here, the `platformdirs package <https://pypi.org/project/platformdirs/>`_ is
    used, providing paths for all major platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux/Unix).

    The given file is searched for in the user-specific data directory
    first, followed by the site-wide data directory. Only if it cannot be
    found in either place, as a fallback the package itself is queried.
    Thus, files under control of the individual user take precedence over
    site-wide files and files distributed with the package.

    A note to obtaining data from the distributed package: Rather than
    manually playing around with paths relative to the package root
    directory, contents of non-code files need to be obtained in a way that
    works with different kinds of package installation.

    Note that in Python, only files within the package, *i.e.* within the
    directory where all the modules are located, can be accessed, not files
    that reside on the root directory of the package.

    .. note::

        In case you would want to get package data from a package different
        than pymetacode, you can prefix the name of the file to retrieve with
        the package name, using the '@' as a separator.

        Suppose you would want to retrieve the file ``__main__.py`` file
        from the "pip" package (why should you?):

        .. code-block::

            get_package_data('pip@__main__.py', directory='')

        This would return the contents of this file. Of course, the sequence
        of directories as described above is used here as well (user data
        directory, site data directory, package directory).


    Parameters
    ----------
    name : :class:`str`
        Name of the file whose contents should be accessed.

        In case the file should be retrieved from a different package,
        the package name can be prefixed, using '@' as a separator.

    directory : :class:`str`
        Directory within the package where the files are located.

        Default: "templates"

    Returns
    -------
    contents : :class:`str`
        String containing the contents of the non-code file.

class ToDictMixin:
    """
    Mixin class for returning all public attributes as dict.

    Sometimes there is the need to either exclude public attributes (in case
    of infinite loops created by trying to apply ``to_dict`` in this case)
    or to add (public) attributes, particularly those used by getters and
    setters that are otherwise not included.

    To do so, there are two non_public attributes of this class each class
    inheriting from it will be able to set as well:

    * :attr:`_exclude_from_to_dict`
    * :attr:`_include_in_to_dict`

    The names should be rather telling. For details, see below.

    Attributes
    ----------
    _exclude_from_to_dict : :class:`list`
        Names of (public) attributes to exclude from dictionary

        Usually, the reason to exclude public attributes from being added to
        the dictionary is to avoid infinite loops, as sometimes an object
        may contain a reference to another object that in turn references back.

    _include_in_to_dict : :class:`list`
        Names of (public) attributes to include into dictionary

        Usual reasons for actively including (public) attributes into the
        dictionary are those attributes accessed by getters and setters and
        hence not automatically included in the list otherwise.

class Template:
    """
    Wrapper for using the template engine (Jinja2).

    Dealing with templates requires a number of settings to be made, namely
    the source of the template, its name, the context (*i.e.*,
    the dictionary containing the variables to be replaced within the
    template), and the destination the rendered template should be output to.

    .. note::

        Regarding the path of a template, three different places are looked
        up, using the function :func:`get_package_data`: first in the user
        data directory, then in the site data directory, and finally within
        the package (distribution). For details see the description of the
        function :func:`get_package_data`.


    Attributes
    ----------
    path : :class:`str`
        Location where the template resides (see note above).

    template : :class:`str`
        Name of the template to be used.

        Relative to the :attr:`package_path`.

        In case you want to retrieve a template for a package different than
        pymetacode, prefix the template name with the package name,
        using '@' as a separator. See :func:`get_package_data` for details.

    context : :class:`dict`
        Key-value store of variables to be replaced within the template.

    destination : :class:`str`

    Examples
    --------

            destination='name_of_the_file_to_output_rendered_template_to',
        )

    Afterwards, the respective command can be issued on the template,
    depending on whether the rendered template should be written or appended
    to the destination:

    Add entries to toc tree.

    Adding lines to toctrees in documentation generated with Sphinx is a
    frequent task for a metacode package. A toctree in Sphinx typically
    looks similar to the following:

    .. code-block:: rst

        .. toctree::
            :maxdepth: 1

            first_entry

    The ``.. toctree::`` directive is followed by (optional) parameters,
    the actual entries appear after a blank line and are indented.

    This function allows to add arbitrary entries to a given toctree,
    as entries are given as list.

    If you would like to have the toctree entries sorted alphabetically,
    make sure to set the ``sort`` parameter to ``True``.

    In case of several toctrees in one document, you may use the
    ``after`` parameter to provide a string as a marker. This string
    is searched for treating it as substring through all lines of the
    file, and the first matching line used as actual offset.

    In case of the file not containing any toctree directive or the string
    provided by ``after`` not being found, exceptions will be thrown.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename : :class:`str`
        Name of the file containing the toctree

    entries : :class:`list`
        lines to be added to the toctree

        Note that regardless of the leading whitespace, entries are left

    sort : :class:`bool`

        Default: False

    after : :class:`str`
