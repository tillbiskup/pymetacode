Main GUI window.

There is usually one main window of a GUI, and this window consists of all
the default parts provided by the Qt framework, namely menu bar and toolbars
at the top, status bar at the bottom, and areas for dockable windows/widgets
on all four sides of the central widget.

Rather than creating an instance of :class:`MainWindow` yourself, you will
usually call the :func:`app.main` function of the :mod:`app` module,
or simply call the GUI by means of the respective gui_scripts entry point
defined in ``setup.py``.


Some notes for developers
=========================

GUI programming can be quite complex, and the :class:`MainWindow` class
provides only a small set of (sensible) defaults for the most common tasks.
However, to help with creating GUIs and to keep the code as readable as
possible, some general advice and an overview of the functionality
implemented are given below.


Saving and restoring GUI settings
---------------------------------

By default, window geometry and state will be saved on close and restored on
startup. This creates a file, typically in the user's home directory,
and depending on the respective platform. Directory and file name depend on
the settings of organisation and application name on the application level.
For details, see the :func:`app.main` function in the :mod:`app` module.

To this end, a private method :meth:`MainWindow._restore_settings` gets
called from the constructor to restore the settings, and the
:meth.`MainWindow.closeEvent` method is overridden to take care of saving
the current settings on closing the GUI.


Adding menus
------------

Menus (and toolbars) are essential aspects of nearly every GUI, particular
the main window. In its default configuration, three menus are created:
"File", "View", and "Help". The "File" menu is populated with a "Quit"
action and associated keyboard shortcut "Ctrl + Q", the "Help" menu with an
"About" action and associated keyboard shortcut "F1". The "View" menu is a
reminder that in case of dockable windows, you need a way to restore windows
closed by the user.

While the :meth:`MainWindow._create_menus` method gets called from the
:meth:`MainWindow.setupUI` method on startup, for the sake of code
readability it is best to separate creating each menu into its own (private)
method that gets called in turn from within the
:meth:`MainWindow._create_menus` method.

Each (active) entry in a menu is an action in Qt speak, and to help with
adding those actions, there is a (private) method
:meth:`MainWindow._create_action` taking a series of parameters. Perhaps it
is best explained with an example:


.. code-block::

    file_quit_action = self._create_action(
        "&Quit",
        self.close,
        QtGui.QKeySequence.Quit or "Ctrl+Q",
        "file_quit",
        "Close the application"
    )


Here, we define the action for quitting the main window and hence the entire
GUI application. The first argument is the text appearing in the menu,
including the keyboard accelerator character. The second argument is the
actual method being called, followed by the keyboard shortcut, a name for an
icon file (entirely optional), and finally an explaining text used as
tooltip in case of a toolbar and shown in the status bar in case of a menu.

Qt actions are defined once and can be used in different contexts: You can
add them to a menu, to a context menu, and to a toolbar. Depending on your
way of organising your code, you will need to either make the actions
(private) attributes of the :class:`MainWindow` class or define menus,
context menus and toolbars all within one method.

A further convenience method helping to add actions to menus is
:meth:`MainWindow._add_actions`. Here, you can not only provide a list of
actions, but "None" as well that will be converted to separators.


Adding dockable windows
-----------------------

Generally, dockable windows need to inherit from
:class:`PySide6.QtWidgets.QDockWidget`. A prototypical class for a dockable
window is shown below. Adapt to your own needs. Of course, a dockable window
can (and usually will) contain arbitrarily complex widgets.


.. code-block::

    class GeneralDockWindow(QtWidgets.QDockWidget):

        def __init__(self, title="General Dock Window"):
            super().__init__()
            self.setObjectName("GeneralDockWindow")
            self.setWindowTitle(title)
            self.list_widget = QtWidgets.QListWidget()
            self.setWidget(self.list_widget)


The possible docking areas the window can be attached to can be restricted
as well:


.. code-block::

    self.setAllowedAreas(Qt.LeftDockWidgetArea | Qt.RightDockWidgetArea)


To add such a dockable window to your main window, extend the
:meth:`MainWindow._create_dock_windows` method in a way similar to the
following:


.. code-block::

    def _create_dock_windows(self):
        general_dock_window_1 = GeneralDockWindow("general 1")
        self.addDockWidget(Qt.LeftDockWidgetArea, general_dock_window_1)
        self._view_menu.addAction(general_dock_window_1.toggleViewAction())


Important here is to add the action to the View menu in order to be able to
restore a closed dockable window. To make things easier, the same can be
achieved using the convenience function :meth:`MainWindow._add_dock_window`:


.. code-block::

    self._add_dock_window(
        GeneralDockWindow,
        "general 1",
        Qt.LeftDockWidgetArea
    )


In case you want to layout two or more dock widgets as tabbed windows,
use the same method, but assign the output to a variable of your choosing,
and afterwards programmatically "tabify" the respective docked windows:


.. code-block::

    dock1 = self._add_dock_window(...)
    dock2 = self._add_dock_window(...)
    self.tabifyDockWidget(dock1, dock2)


Just make sure that both windows you want to appear in tabs are set to the
same docking area. Otherwise, the first one will "win" and drag the second
one to the same docking area.


Preventing loss of work on closing the GUI
------------------------------------------

As soon as the user can change contents from within the GUI, it may no
longer be safe to simply close the window and hence quit the entire
application. The same is true for changes that need to be applied or
discarded before switching to some other dataset or else. To detect (and
handle) the situation when changes are present that have not yet been saved,
reimplement the method :meth:`MainWindow._ok_to_continue` according to your
needs. Furthermore, this method allows for convenient and readable code
similar to


.. code-block::

    if self._ok_to_continue():
        ...


For an actual example, you may have a look at the
:meth:`MainWindow.closeEvent` method.

            The non-pythonic name comes from the analogy to windows generated
